## Java

We suggest to use our [Tisana4j REST client library](https://github.com/ClouDesire/tisana4j) to build a client to call our API.
We are planning to relase an official Java API client in the future.

## PHP

We suggest to use the great [Guzzle](http://guzzle.readthedocs.org/) to build a client to call our API.

## CLI tool

We suggest to use [HTTPie](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie) to call our API via a command-line tool to experiment.
