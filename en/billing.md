ClouDesire provides complete billing features.
This section will explain some main concepts and implemented use-cases.

# Glossay

* **Application**: a web-based (or MS Windows desktop) software product
* **Vendor**: user that offers his applications in the ClouDesire Marketplace. Each application can have a specific **recurrent license** or can be offered for free. In addition, vendor can specifiy **custom metrics** for his applications (i.e. number of users, number of documents, etc.) specifying the related unit price; in this way, **pay-per-use** pricing models can be defined (i.e. 10 USD per active user, 20 USD per document, etc.)
* **Customer**: user that buys applications in the ClouDesire Marketplace
* **Order**: when a customer buys an application, ClouDesire creates an *order* that contains the following information: duration (i.e. 1 year, 6 months, etc.), nominee (the customer name), purchased application name, order type (can be *normal*, *trial*, *sandbox*, *upgrade*, *renewal*), total amount
* **Subscription**: for each order, ClouDesire creates a *subscription* that has a specfic lifetime, depending on the order duration 
* **Invoice**: during the subscription lifetime, ClouDesire issues a certain number of invoices, depending on the **Billing Period** (i.e. every month, every 3 months, etc.). The *Billing Period* is a platform configuration setting. 
* **Revenues Report**: a document, that is periodically provided to the vendor, containing all the revenues generated by the sales of his applications in a certain period of time. The revenues corresponds to the total amount of the applications licenses sold plus the **pay-per-use application metrics** revenues, net of the **ClouDesire fee**. 
 
# Main Concepts

## Invoices
Each ClouDesire *invoice* contains the following items:
 * nominee (the *Customer* name)
 * purchased application name
 * application **recurrent license** cost
 * **pay-per-use application metrics** costs (i.e. 1.000,00 USD for 10 active users in the previous *billing period*) 
 * IaaS costs (VM instance, bandwidth, disk space)

## Billing Rules
 * at the beginning of the *billing period* (i.e the first day of every month) all the invoices containing the application license cost and the IaaS costs are issued **in advance** to the customers
 * at the end of the *billing period* (i.e the last day of every month) all the invoices containing the *pay-per-use application metrics* costs are issued to the customers
 * if an application is offered in **trial mode**, when the customer uses (*try*) it, ClouDesire issues an invoice to the vendor for the related IaaS costs. These costs are substracted to the vendors' revenues in the *Revenues Report*.
 * when the vendor executes a depolyment test (**sandbox**) for one of his application, ClouDesire issues an invoice to him for the related IaaS costs. These costs are substracted to the vendors' revenues in the *Revenues Report*.

## Level of Configurability
 * every Vendor can decide his preferred *billing frequency* (that is a multiple of the *billing period*)
 * every Customer can decide his preferred order duration (that is a multiple of the *billing frequency*)

## Orders Renewal
 * some days before the subscription expiration, ClouDesire notice the customer asking for a renewal and creating an invoice that need to be paid by him
 * if the customer doesn't renew his subscription (namely doesn't pay the related invoice), ClouDesire *stops* (suspends) the related application's instance and waits some days (the precise number is configurable) for the payment. If after this period the customer doesn't pay the invoice, ClouDesire destroys the application instance.

## Prepaid Bandwidth Management
 * vendors can freely specify a certain **amount of prepaid bandwidth** for each application sold in the ClouDesire Marketplace
 * ClouDesire manage the bandwidth price for each supported cloud provider
 * if the vendor desn't set a specific prepaid bandwidth amount to his application, ClouDesire associates a **default prepaid bandwidth package** (i.e. 10GB)
 * during the deployed application lifetime, if the bandwidth usage exceeds 90% of the established limit, ClouDesire send a notification email to the customer, asking for a **bandwidth upgrade order**. If the customer doesn't execute the upgrade, ClouDesire avoid to access the application.

## Disk Space Management
 * vendors can freely specify a certain **amount of disk space** for each application sold in the ClouDesire Marketplace
 * ClouDesire manage the disk space price for each supported cloud provider
 * during the deployed application lifetime, if disk space usage exceeds 90% of the established limit, ClouDesire send a notification email to the customer, asking for a **disk upgrade order**. 

## Backup Management
 * ClouDesire allows the customers to buy **backup plans**. 
 * every *backup plan* includes to a maximum number of backups executions (configurable in the platform) that can be **manually performed** by the customers or **scheduled**
 * a *backup plan* must be paid by the customer in advance
 * if the customer needs to perform a manual backup when the maximum limit in the *backup plan* is reached, a new **backup order** is created and a related invoice is issued. In this case, the backup starts only when the invoice is paid.
 
## Payments
 * to date, the supported payment gateway is **PayPal**
 * after the sale of an application, when the customer pays the related invoice, normally ClouDesire automatically starts the application deployment process on the selected cloud providers. A specific platform configuration parameter, allows to modify this default forkflow, expeting a second explicit vendor approval before to start the deployment process.
