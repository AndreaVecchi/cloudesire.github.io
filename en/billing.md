ClouDesire provides complete billing features.
This section will explain some main concepts and implemented use-cases.

# Legenda

* **Application**: a web-based (or MS Windows desktop) software
* **Vendor**: user that offers his *applications* in the ClouDesire Marketplace
* **Customer**: user that buys *applications* in the ClouDesire Marketplace
* **Order**: when a *customer* buys an *application*, ClouDesire creates an *order* that contains the following information:
 * nominee (the *Customer* name)
 * duration
 * type: can be *normal*, *trial*, *sandbox*, *upgrade*, *renewal*
 * total amount
* **Subscription**: for each order, ClouDesire creates a *subscription* that has a specfic lifetime, depending on the *order* duration
* **Invoice**: during the *subscription* lifetime, ClouDesire issues a certain number of invoices, depending on the **Billing Period** (i.e. every month, every 3 months, etc.) configured in the platform. Each *invoice* contains the following items:
 * nominee (the *Customer* name)
 * applications **recurrent license** cost
 * **pay-per-use** application resources (i.e. number of users, number of documents, etc.)
 * IaaS costs (VM instance, bandwidth, disk space)
* **Revenues Report**: a document, that is periodically provided to the vendor, containing all the revenues generated by the sales of his applications in a certain period of time. The revenues corresponds to the total amount of the applications licenses plus the pay-per-use application resources usage, net of the **ClouDesire fee**. 
 
# Main Concepts

## Level of Configurability
 * every Vendor can decide his preferred billing frequency
 * every Customer can decide his preferred order duration (that is a multiple of the billing frequency)

## Billing Frequency
 * at the beginning of the billing period (i.e the first day of every month) all the invoices containing the application license cost and the IaaS costs are issued **in advance** to the customers
 * at the end of the billing period (i.e the last day of every month) all the invoices containing the pay-per-use application resources are issued to the customers

## Orders Renewal
 * some days before the subscription expiration, ClouDesire notice the customer asking for a renewal and creating an invoice that need to be paid by him
 * if the customer doesn't renew his subscription (namely doesn't pay the related invoice), ClouDesire *stops* (suspends) the related application's instance and waits some days (the precise number is configurable) for the payment. If after this period the customer doesn't pay the invoice, ClouDesire destroys the application instance.

## Prepaid Bandwidth Management
 * vendors can freely specify a certain **amount of prepaid bandwidth** for each application sold in the ClouDesire Marketplace
 * ClouDesire manage the bandwidth price for each supported cloud provider
 * if the vendor desn't set a specific prepaid bandwidth amount to his application, ClouDesire associates a **default prepaid bandwidth package** (i.e. 10GB)
 * during the deployed application lifetime, if the bandwidth usage exceeds 90% of the established limit, ClouDesire send a notification email to the customer, asking for a **bandwidth upgrade order**. If the customer doesn't execute the upgrade, ClouDesire avoid to access the application.

## Disk Space Management
 * vendors can freely specify a certain **amount of disk space** for each application sold in the ClouDesire Marketplace
 * ClouDesire manage the disk space price for each supported cloud provider
 * during the deployed application lifetime, if disk space usage exceeds 90% of the established limit, ClouDesire send a notification email to the customer, asking for a **disk upgrade order**. 

## Backup Management
 * *To be described*
 
## Payments
 * to date, the supported payment gateway is **PayPal**
 * after the sale of an application, when the customer pays the related invoice, normally ClouDesire automatically starts the application deployment process on the selected cloud providers. A specific platform configuration parameter, allows to modify this default forkflow, expeting a second explicit vendor approval before to start the deployment process.
