A syndicated application is an application that is directly erogated by the software vendor, and not hosted on the platform itself.

This feature enables software vendor to sell applications that are natively multi-tenant and that can provision new tenants almost instantaneously, and for which the vendor already manage a platform to deliver it to customers.

The platform is used only for the marketplace/billing features and not for the operations, that are directly managed by the software vendor.

To achieve this purpose, the platform will send REST requests to a vendor-specified endpoint, defined during the main product creation process, for the most interesting events generated by users on the marketplace (new subscription created, customer information changed and so on).

## Events

The events sent to the vendor endpoint contains a JSON payload in the form:

```
POST /custom_endpoint
{
  "entity": "Subscription",
  "id": 18,
  "date": "2015-01-12T11:19:30Z",
  "type": "CREATED"
}
```

The type attribute can be: **CREATED**, **MODIFIED**, **DELETED**

Events are currently sent only for the resource Subscription, but we will add more in the future.
